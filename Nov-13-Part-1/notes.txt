static variables : These are the variables, that which retains values irrespective of 
type of objects. 

Inheritance : The concept of deriving a new class from already 
existing class known as inheritance, the class which derived known 
as derived class, the class from which its derived known as base class.

Through inheritance, we can reduce the size of the program. 

Syntax : 

class First {
...
...
...
}

class Second extends First {
...
...
...
}

Once you create an object to Second class, then you can access all 
public/protected and friendly members of base class. 

super keyword : If you want to pass values from derived class to base class, then we need the help of super keyword. It has 2 forms as 

(i) super as a keyword

(ii) super as a constructor 

Abstract Class : A class, that which can be created but not implemented and instantiated known as abstract class.  Abstract class contains abstract and non-abstract methods, only abstract methods needs to be overrided mandatory by the derived class. 

abstract class Abstract_class
{
   abstract method1();
   abstract method2();
}


1) Write a program to display a number from (1 to 9999) in rowman format

2) Write a Program to print multiplication of 2 numbers (100 digit * 100 digit i want exact value dont use BigInt class) 

interface : Java does not support the concept of multiple inheritance, to achieve this we need the help of interfaces. An interface contains method declaration and the implementation can be done the correspoinding class, you can add more than one interface to the particular class. 

Difference between interface and abstract class
_______________________________________________

(i) Abstract class contains both abstract and non-abstract methods, where interface contains only abstract methods. 

(ii) Interface methods are public and abstract by default.

(iii) Multiple inheritance can be achieved by using interfaces

(iv) An interface can be called from anywhere to anywhere. 


you can define an interface as 

interface interface_name {
...
...
}

interface contains variables that are static and final means final variables cannot be updated.
