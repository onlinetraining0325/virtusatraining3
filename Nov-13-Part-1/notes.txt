static variables : These are the variables, that which retains values irrespective of 
type of objects. 

Inheritance : The concept of deriving a new class from already 
existing class known as inheritance, the class which derived known 
as derived class, the class from which its derived known as base class.

Through inheritance, we can reduce the size of the program. 

Syntax : 

class First {
...
...
...
}

class Second extends First {
...
...
...
}

Once you create an object to Second class, then you can access all 
public/protected and friendly members of base class. 

super keyword : If you want to pass values from derived class to base class, then we need the help of super keyword. It has 2 forms as 

(i) super as a keyword

(ii) super as a constructor 

Abstract Class : A class, that which can be created but not implemented and instantiated known as abstract class.  Abstract class contains abstract and non-abstract methods, only abstract methods needs to be overrided mandatory by the derived class. 

abstract class Abstract_class
{
   abstract method1();
   abstract method2();
}
