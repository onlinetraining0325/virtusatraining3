What is Synchronized 

As compared with synchronized, lock is more flexible and sophisticated thread synchronized mechanism than the standard. 

The Lock interface has been around in java.util.Concurrency package, it provides extensive operartion for locking. 


Differences between Synchronized and Lock 

Synchronized frully contained within a method, wher lock 
API lock() and unlock() operation in separate method. 

A thread gets blocked by using synchronized block, where Lock API
provides tryLock() method.  The thread acquires lock only if its available and not held by any other thread. 

So by using lock() we can manage fairness of the code. 

We have various methods as 

lock() : Applies lock() if its available, if the lock is not available, the thread gets blocked until the lock is present. 

tryLock() : APplies the lock immediately. 

unlock() : Unlock the locked thread. 

One of the major class we have in locking is 

ReentrantLock : Its from Lock interface, it offers same concurrency and memory semantic as the implicit monitor lock accessed.
