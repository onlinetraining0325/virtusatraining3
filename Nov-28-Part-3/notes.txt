What is Dependency Injection : Object is not looking for the resources it is depending on. DI is a feature, ensures as soon That is, dependencies are injected into objects as soon as object created. Thus lookups are completely removed from application objects and it can be used outside the container also.  

How to implement Dependency Injection 
______________________________________

There are 2 types of DI as

1) Constructor Injection

2) Getter and Setter Injection

Assume we have as class as NameBean

  public class NameBean 
{ 
     String      name; 
  
     public void setName(String a) 
     { 
        name = a; 
     } 
     public String getName() 
     { 
        return name; 
     } 
} 

NameBean obj = new NameBean();
obj.setName("Gaurav");

<bean id="bean1" class="NameBean">
    <property name="name" value="Gaurav" />
</bean>

1) BeanFactory

2) ApplicationContext 

ApplicationContext ctx = new ClassPathXmlApplicationContext("xmlfile");
