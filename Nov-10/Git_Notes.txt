GIT

Version Control System : It is all about managing multiple versions of
documents, programs and websites etc...

   -> Production env projects use version control tool
   -> Essential for team projects, but also very useful for 
	individual projects. 

These kind of operations we need to make it then GIT plays 
vital role in this. 

There we have one centralized version control system, 
the central server repo holds the master copy of your project, and everytime
the code gets updated after verification (pull request) - and all the history
getting being recorded. 

Advantages : 
____________

	-> Changes will be recorded and updated after approval
	-> Always we can deal with working copy
	-> Identify the changes to be done by individual 
	-> Only working code to be commited 


Git contains 4 major partitions known as

1) Working Directory : This the default directory where (repo) we can do 
actual changes and coding. 

2) Staging Area : This is the place where we need to stage files or data. Ensure
the staged files are to be merged to the repository as working code. 

3) Local Repository : This is the repository which exists in the user system, as we need to finalize or commit the changes before remote, we need to commit here. Once you commit the changes here then only we can add to remote. 

4) Remote Repository : This is the repository, where we can commit our changes and see in remote location. 


How to Download files from GitHub repository first time 

git clone : This command allows you to download the files from GitHub repository specified. 


Step 1 :

To stage a file, we need to use the command as

git add 

git add <filename>

To add all files including changes 

git add .


Step 2: 

To Add the file to the local repository, use the command as

git commit -m "message"

git commit -m "My First Commit"

Step 3 : 

To add a file to the remote repository, 

git push origin branch_name 

git push origin main

git status : Used to display the current status of the git. 

git log : Used to display history of the git commands. 

git diff : Used to find the diff between old commit (vs) current stage.

git checkout filename : Used to cancel the changes before staging. 

<<<<<<< HEAD
git reset HEAD file_name : Used to unstage a file. 

git reset HEAD Greeting.txt : Used to unstage the given file. 

git branch branch_name : Used to create a branch

git branch lokesh

git branch : Used to list out the branches

git checkout branch_name : Used to switch to the branch

git checkout lokesh :

git pull : Used to pull/download files from other branch

git pull origin branch_name : 

git pull origin lokesh : From lokesh branch all files getting downloaded.

git branch -b branch_name : It creates a branch and enters 

git branch -D branch_name : Used to remove the branch (non-empty also)


Rebase ensures the starting point of a branch.

This concept can be used when we want to isolate a branch as some drastic damage happend.

In Rebase

Git removes the changes temporirly
Then it adds the lastest ork rom the branch you rebased
Then it reapplies the changes on it
New commit version will be created.
