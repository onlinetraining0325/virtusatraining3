Collections : Arrays are static data structures means, once they are assigned
we cannot alter the size. So, if want to add the elements irrespective of size
then we need the help of collections. 

Collections can grow to any size unlike arrays. 

Collections are from java.util package 

Collections stores data w.r.t. Object format. 

Collection framework contains major interfaces as

1) List : Allows you to add elements in sequential order. There are major collection
classes falling under List interface are 

   (i) ArrayList

   (ii) Vector 



2) Set : Used to eliminate duplicate entries at the time of display.  HashSet and LinkedHashSet are falling under Set interface. 

3) SortedSet : This interface allows you to display data w.r.t. Sorted format. TreeSet is falling under SortedSet interface. 

Generics provides an opportunity to protect a field in a class. If you want to make any method as write once and apply for all types then we need the help of generics. Generics will be represented by using <T>, means in place of <T> we can pass 

value types
reference types
custom types

Advantages : 

	-> Write Once and apply for all types

	-> Provides the security to the data

	-> No Typecasting

	-> Reduces the size of the code.
