Data Types : 
_____________

There are 2 types of data types as 

(i) value types

    int 
    float
    double
    char
    Boolean 

etc...

(ii) reference types 

String
Object
user-define class 

*** Value types will be stored in STACK memory and reference types will be stored in HEAP memory ***

You can define a method in java as 

access-modifier return-type method(parameter(s)) {
...
...
...
}

You can create an object to the class, as 

class_name obj = new class_name();

The default package in java is lang, you can define as java.lang 

The top level class in java is java.lang.Object 

Scanner class allows you to read the custom input from the keyboard. 

It is from util package. 

nextInt()
next()
nextLine()
nextDouble()

Control Structures : Used to define the flow of the program. There are 2 types of control structures known as 

(i) Branching

	if...else : Executes the statements based on the condition.
		
		if (condition) {
			statement(s);
		} else {
		    statement(s);
		}

switch...case : Used to define the menu-driven programs. 

switch(expression) {
   case expression1 : statement(s);
		      break;
   case expression2 : statemenet(s);
		      break;
    ...
    ...
    ...
}

What is yield : 

Yield keyword lets us exists a switch expression by returning a value that becomes the value of switch expression.
This means we can assign the value of a switch expression to a variable. 

Lastly, by using yield in switch... we can get implicit check that we are covering all cases. 

(ii) Looping 

while loop : This loop executes all the statements repeatedly until the condition remains true, if the condition remains false, then it comes out of the loop.  For every loop, basically there are 3 phases known as 

	(i) Initialization : Performed at the beginning of the loop

	(ii) Condition : Performed at the conditional part of the loop.

	(iii) Increment/Decrement : Performed before closing the loop.

while(condition) {
   statement(s);
}

for loop : This loop executes all the statements repeatedly until the condition remains true, if the condition remains false, then it comes out of the loop. 

for(initialization;condition;increment/decrement) {
  statement(s);
}
