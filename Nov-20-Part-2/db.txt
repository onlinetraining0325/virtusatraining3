Relational Model the concept of tables came into the picture,

as Table contains data w.r.t Rows and Columns.  No.of rows are called cardinality and No.of attributes are called Degree of the table. 

Relational System identifies data w.r.t. Keys. 

There are various types of keys as 

Employ(Empno,Ename,job,Salary,SalaryDate,AadharNo)

(i) Candidate Key : Any key that which uniquely identifies rows of table known as candidate key. (Empno, AadharNo)

(ii) Primary Key : One of the candidate key needs to be chosen as primary key based on priority. (Empno) { Primary Key cannot be NULL, No Duplicate}

(iii) Composite Key : Any key that which uniquely identifies rows of a table made up of more than one attribute known as composite key (Empno+SalaryDate) 

(iv) Alternate Key : Any key that which is Candidate Key but not primary key known as alternate key (AadharNo)

(v) Foreign Key : Primary key in the parent table will be foreign key in child table.
